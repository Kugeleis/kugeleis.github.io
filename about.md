# About This Blog

Welcome to my blog about biking through Japan!

This page will eventually contain more information about the journey, the gear, and the rider. For now, it's a placeholder to show that the about page is working and fits into the navigation.

## The Journey

From Fukuoka to Hokkaido, exploring the beautiful landscapes and culture of Japan on two wheels.

## The Bike

Details about the bike and equipment used for this adventure will be shared here.
